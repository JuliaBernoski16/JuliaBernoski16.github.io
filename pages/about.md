  I am a Front-end Web Developer and UI/UX enthusiast. I am currently working
  part-time as a Content Coordinator at a small web development company called
  eConverse. I want to become a well rounded-developer and I find being able to
  understand all aspects is crucial to becoming a great developer which is why I
  love my role as a content coordinator, I get to start off with a blank canvas,
  and come back to a fully functional site!
